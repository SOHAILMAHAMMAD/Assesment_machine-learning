**Upstox API Integration for Options Chain Analysis**
This project is a Python-based integration with the Upstox API, designed to fetch options chain data, calculate the required margins, and determine premiums for both call and put options. It demonstrates how to interact with a financial API for retrieving critical trading information.

**Code Structure and Logic**
1. Initial Imports and Setup
The project imports necessary libraries: pandas for data manipulation, requests for HTTP requests, and upstox-python-sdk for API interactions.
It uses pip commands to ensure all dependencies are installed at runtime.
2. API Credentials and Authentication
The script begins by setting up API credentials (key, secret, and code) for secure authentication.
It constructs URLs for Upstox API endpoints and sends a POST request to obtain an access token. This token is essential for making further API requests.
3. Fetching Instrument Data
The code reads instrument data from a CSV URL provided by Upstox, using pandas to load and filter the data.
It identifies the instrument key for the trading symbol 'SAIL' to be used in options chain requests.
4. Options Chain Request
A request is made to the Upstox API to fetch the options chain for a specific instrument and expiry date.
The response data is converted into a DataFrame for easier data handling and visualization.
The script extracts the instrument keys for the call and put options of interest.
5. Margin and Premium Calculations
Calculate Margin: A helper function sends a request to the margin endpoint, fetching the margin required for trading a specified quantity of the instrument.
Calculate Premium: Another helper function queries the quote endpoint to retrieve the last traded price (premium) for the instrument.
6. Displaying Results
The script outputs the margin and premium values for both call and put options, providing a clear financial snapshot.
**Specific Details About the Approach**
Authorization Flow: The code uses a secure OAuth flow to request an access token, ensuring sensitive data remains protected.
Efficient Data Handling: pandas is used for efficient data manipulation and filtering.
Error Handling: The functions include basic error handling to print status codes when requests fail, making debugging easier.
API Requests: The code relies heavily on the requests library to interact with various Upstox API endpoints, structuring headers and parameters carefully.
